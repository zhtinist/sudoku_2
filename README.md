The source code of Huazhong University of Science and Technology's data structure course (Cellular Sudoku) and the dpll part refer to other public libraries on github. I would like to thank you for this.
Modular functions are included in the include folder

The test folder is a calculation example used by teaching assistants to check in 2023. According to the test, the computer I use can easily run calculation examples 1~6 (within 10s). Examples after 7 are subject to RAM restrictions and have a long running time.
My computer configuration is as follows:

Processor 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12500H 2.50 GHz

Onboard RAM 16.0 GB (15.7 GB available)
